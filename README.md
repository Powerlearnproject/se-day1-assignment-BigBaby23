Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineer principles, designs and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software system.
It is important in the creation of software and system application that makes day to day activities of life easier. such as communication, health care, trading.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Software engineering as a discipline in 1960s
Development of programming language.(fortran)
the rise in agile methodology in the 2000s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements: gathering and documentation of required informations needed for ge users.
Design: creating detailed design of the software architect and user interface.
Implementation: writing code abd building software according to the design specifications 
Testing: confucting different test to be sure the softwares meet quality standard and functional requirements 
Deployment: releasing the software th the user.
Maintenance: addition of updated features, provision of support after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: Sequential approach using distinctive phases flowing down wards like a water fall. (e.g requirement, design, implementation) 
Agile: iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility collaboration and responding to changes.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: writes codes and implements software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer : ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: oversees planning, execution and  delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated development: Software suites that provides comprehensive tools for writings, debugging abd testing ( e.g visual studio, eclipse, intelliJ IDEA ).
Version Control System: Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating works among members. (Git, Sub version).


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Change in requirement: may occur during the development circle, leading to scope, creep abd project delay 
Tight Schedules: pressure to deliver software project at a given time can lead to rushed work with compromised quality 
Technical debts: accrued from short cut or sub optional solutions. this can impede  to future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Testing individual component or module of a software.
Integration Testing: testing interactions between different components 
System Testing: Testing the entire software as a whole.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is like creating a special recipe for your robot. Just like a recipe tells you exactly what ingredients to use and how to mix them to bake a delicious cake, a prompt tells the robot exactly what information you need and how you want it presented.

Importance of prompt Engineering

Determine your goal for Al tools.
Perform tests
Consider using machine learning methods.
Separating instructions
Try to be specific as possible.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt: How to Bake bread.
Prompt response: How to bake banana bread using flour and banana as the preferred flavourreed
